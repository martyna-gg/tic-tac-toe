# Tic-tac-toe

My first program in Python - tic-tac-toe game for two players with usage of functions, nested lists, list comprehension, handling errors, if/else/elif statements, for and while loops and processing user input.

## Requirements

Code was developed and tested using:


Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS


Python 3.6.9

## Usage

The game is played it turns. The X player starts. To play your turn insert two coordinates of game board (row and column).

```
$ python3 tic-tac-toe.py
---------
|       |
|       |
|       |
---------
give me two coordinates of your  next move, please: >2 1
---------
|       |
| X     |
|       |
---------
give me two coordinates of your  next move, please: >3 3   
---------
|       |
| X     |
|     O |
---------

```

The game ends when one of the players wins or when there is a draw.

```
---------
| X O   |
|   X   |
| O   X |
---------
X wins

```

```
---------
| X O X |
| O O X |
| X X O |
---------
Draw

```

## Support

## Roadmap
